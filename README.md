# Welcome to Apache Flume Hadoop!

Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available service for efficiently
collecting, aggregating, and moving large amounts of event data. It has a simple
and flexible architecture based on streaming data flows. It is robust and fault
tolerant with tunable reliability mechanisms and many failover and recovery
mechanisms. The system is centrally managed and allows for intelligent dynamic
management. It uses a simple extensible data model that allows for online
analytic application.

The Apache Flume Hadoop module provides Flume components that leverage Hadoop technologies.

Apache Flume Hadoop is open-sourced under the Apache Software Foundation License v2.0.
